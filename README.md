This is my project for the "Theoretical and Numerical Aspects of Nuclear Physics" course.
It contains the two papers that i used as resource and the two programs that i made on Matlab.
Program should be sufficently commented and a quick description of the code is present at the start of each one.
Also my presentation for the exam is present.
